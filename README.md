This project aims to develop a system to monitor driver alertness and detect alcohol consumption in real-time. Using machine learning and computer vision techniques, the system tracks driver behavior and provides alerts for potential drowsiness or alcohol impairment.

Features
Driver Drowsiness Detection and alcohol impairment detection: Monitors eye movements, facial expressions, and head position to detect signs of drowsiness,alcohol consumption levels through facial analysis .
Real-time Alerts: Provides real-time warnings when dangerous driving behavior is detected and takes the snapshot if alcohol consumption is detected
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries (e.g., OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow)


tep 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Sejaldahal/Drowsiness-and-alcohol-detction-system.git
cd Drowsiness-and-alcohol-detction-system
Step 2: Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Set Up the Submodule (if applicable)
If your project includes submodules, initialize them:

bash
Copy code
git submodule update --init --recursive
Usage
Run the main Python script to start the driver monitoring system:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
The system will start capturing video from the webcam (or connected camera) and monitor the driver for drowsiness and alcohol detection.
Capturing a Snapshot
To capture a snapshot from the camera, you can use the following Python script:

bash
Copy code
python snapshot.py
Example Instructions for Your Friends
You can add a code space for any commands or code you want your friends to copy. For example:

### To Run the System

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sejaldahal/Drowsiness-and-alcohol-detction-system.git
Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the driver monitoring system:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Capture a snapshot from the camera:
bash
Copy code
python snapshot.py
yaml
Copy code

This way, all commands will be displayed inside **code blocks** that can be easily copied and pasted.

---

### Key Syntax for Code Blocks:

1. **For inline code**: Wrap the code in single backticks (\`), like this:  
   ```markdown
   `python main.py`
For multi-line code blocks: Use triple backticks (```) to create a block, like this:

markdown
Copy code
python main.py

go
Copy code

You can also specify the programming language (e.g., `bash`, `python`) after the first set of triple backticks for syntax highlighting:

```markdown
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sejaldahal/Drowsiness-and-alcohol-detction-system.git
Copy code
